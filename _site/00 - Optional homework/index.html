<p>For this initial homework we will be training with the <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/">gunshot deaths</a>
dataset. Get it <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data/blob/master/interactive_data.csv">here</a>. The goal of this optional homework is to use an IPython Notebook to reproduce
the results reported in the visualization at the top of the article (e.g., “nearly two-thirds of gun deaths are suicides”).
It’s not necessary to generate visualizations for the results – numbers should be more than enough to convince yourself that you 
were able to reproduce the results of that article.</p>

<p>You can use this opportunity first of all to refresh your Python skills. If you are coming from another programming language
(especially a static PL like Java and C++), I recommend you to take a look at this presentation:
<a href="http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/presentation.html">Code Like a Pythonista: Idiomatic Python</a> – it will teach
you how to write nice Python code, while at the same time getting you up to speed with the syntax.
Feel free to explore more advanced libraries (like <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>) if you really want, but keep in mind that you
should be able to reproduce the results with the Python Standard Library.
One advantage of using only the PSL is that once you will get knowledgeable about Pandas you will appreciate how much more concise
and readable your code will become :)</p>
