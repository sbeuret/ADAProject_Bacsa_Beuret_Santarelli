    "limited, some parties will never get enough votes to be representated, therefore part of the Swiss population is de facto excluded from parlementary debates.\n",
    "In this study, we intend to explore the Swiss OpenData dataset's electoral and economical data. We would then like to clusters the different 'Communes' into \n",

But since the tool provided has a bounded number of downloadable cells, the dataset was downloaded into two Excel documents.\n",
    "These Excel files were loaded and merged in a single dataframe. We recovered the results of the 2015 Swiss National Council election (Election au Conseil National) for each municipality (commune):\n",

Then, we recovered the adjacent municipalities using the function *neighbors* from the JavaScript module *topojson* [[documentation](https://github.com/topojson/topojson)] and saved the names of municipalities and their neighbors in a CSV file named *graph_communes.csv*.

Between 2013 and 2015, many municipalities were merged. The  dataframe of the adjacent communes was updated as such (c'est pas la bonne expression).\n",
    "That explains why later on, we used another TopoJson to visualize the most recent municipalities. An other reason also was that the TopoJson didn't use Switzerland absolute coordinates and therefore it was not possible to use *folium* to implement a choropleth map of the municipalities.\n",

    "Another idea that has not been tried out yet would be to use spectral clustering for feature extraction. Essentially, by mapping the municipalities to a similarity graph using a distance map, we could derive a set of features based on the eigenvectors of the Laplacian of said graph. This would enable us to reduce the dimentions of the Swiss political spectrum from 24 parties to a few abtract features. Combined with other features derived from other factors such as spoken-language, geography, etc..., we can use traditional machine learning techniques to cluster our municipalities into new cantons. \n",
