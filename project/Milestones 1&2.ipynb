    "## Abstract\n",
    "The cantonal borders in Switzerland have mostly stayed fixed since the 19th century, and in some cases, even the Middle-Ages. Therefore, they sometimes \n",
    "do not take into account the evolutions of the Swiss society that occured in the last 150 years. Furthermore, since the number of seats the parlement is \n",
    "limited, some parties will never get enough votes to be representated, therefore part of the Swiss population is de facto excluded from parlementary debates.\n",
    "In this study, we intend to explore the Swiss OpenData dataset's electoral and economical data. We would then like to clusters the different 'Communes' into \n",
    "new Cantons. These new Cantons would then exibit the best political representation of Switzerland. We would like to study the influence of the political \n",
    "partitioning on the parlement's composition. To this effect, we will tweak the different parameters of our model to study its effect. We can also verify \n",
    "the quality of the current partition.\n",

    "## Research questions\n",
    "- Can we construct an optimal partition for the Council of States ?\n",
    "- Can we construct an optimal partition for the National Council ?\n",
    "- Is it possible to optmize both at the same time ?\n",
    "- Can geography be taken into account in order to keep coherent borders ?\n",
    "- Can social factors be taken into account ?\n",
    "- Can the current representation be rated as fair ?\n",
    "- Can we do the opposite and find the least fair partitioning ?\n",
